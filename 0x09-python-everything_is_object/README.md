# 0x09-python-everything_is_object

This repository contains solutions and explanations for the tasks in the "0x09-python-everything_is_object" project, which is part of the curriculum in Python programming.

## Description

In this project, we explore the concept of objects in Python and how everything in Python is an object. We delve into various aspects of objects, such as their creation, properties, behavior, and mutability.

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of objects and their behavior in Python. These tasks cover topics such as object identity, object mutability, object references, and the operations performed on objects.

The solutions provided in this repository are implemented in Python language and are structured in separate files, each corresponding to a specific task. Additionally, each file contains a detailed explanation of the task and the approach used to solve it.
