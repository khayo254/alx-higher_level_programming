# 0x03-python-data_structures

This repository contains solutions for the tasks related to data structures in Python, completed as part of the curriculum in the 0x03-python-data_structures module.

## Description

The 0x03-python-data_structures module focuses on data structures in Python programming. It covers concepts and implementation details of various built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. The tasks in this module provide practical exercises to reinforce understanding and demonstrate proficiency in working with these data structures.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: Python script that defines a function to print all integers in a list.
- `1-element_at.py`: Python script that defines a function to retrieve an element at a specific index in a list.
- `2-replace_in_list.py`: Python script that defines a function to replace an element at a specific index in a list.
- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`: Python script that defines a function to print all integers in a list in reverse order.
- `4-new_in_list.py`: Python script that defines a function to replace an element in a list at a specific index without modifying the original list.
- `5-no_c.py`: Python script that defines a function to remove all occurrences of a character from a string.
- `6-print_matrix_integer.py`: Python script that defines a function to print a matrix of integers.
