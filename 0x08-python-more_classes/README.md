# 0x08 Python More Classes

This project contains exercises and assignments related to Python classes. The goal of this project is to further enhance your understanding of classes and their usage in Python.

In this project, you will explore various concepts and techniques related to Python classes. Classes are an integral part of object-oriented programming (OOP) and provide a way to define objects with their properties and behaviors.

The exercises and assignments in this project will cover topics such as:

- Creating and defining classes
- Class attributes and instance attributes
- Class methods and instance methods
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Special methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`)
- Class composition and aggregation

By completing these exercises, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to design and implement classes, leverage inheritance and polymorphism, and create reusable code structures.
