# Hello World

## Overview
This README documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a simple "Hello World" program using Python. We will use the Python programming language to print the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

## Instructions
Follow these instructions to create and run a "Hello World" program using Python:

1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Create a new file and save it with a `.py` extension. For example, you can name the file `hello_world.py`.
3. Open the `hello_world.py` file in your text editor or IDE.
4. In the file, write the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

5. Save the file.

### Running the Program
To run the "Hello World" program, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `hello_world.py` file.
3. Run the program by executing the following command:

```shell
python hello_world.py
```

4. After executing the command, you should see the output `Hello, World!` displayed in the console.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and executed a "Hello World" program using Python.

## Conclusion
Printing "Hello, World!" is a common first step when learning a new programming language. In this guide, we used Python to create a simple program that prints this phrase to the console. This example demonstrates the basic syntax and structure of a Python program. You can now build upon this foundation to explore more complex Python programming concepts and develop a wide range of applications.
