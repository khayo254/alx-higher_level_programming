# 0x01 Python - If-Else, Loops, Functions

This repository contains exercises and examples related to Python's control flow statements, including if-else statements, loops, and functions. These concepts are fundamental to programming and are essential for building logic and controlling the flow of a program.

## Topics Covered

The repository covers the following topics:

1. **If-Else Statements**: Learn how to perform conditional execution based on different conditions using if-else statements. Understand how to use comparison operators, logical operators, and nested if-else statements.

1. **Loops**: Explore different loop constructs in Python, including `for` and `while` loops. Understand how to use loops to iterate over sequences, such as lists, strings, and dictionaries. Learn about loop control statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.

1. **Functions**: Discover the concept of functions and their importance in modular programming. Learn how to define, call, and use functions in Python. Understand the different types of function parameters, return values, and function scope.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
